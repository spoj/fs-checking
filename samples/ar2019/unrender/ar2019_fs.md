# Independent Auditor’s Report

**To the Shareholders of Li & Fung Limited**
*(incorporated in Bermuda with limited liability)*

### Opinion

#### What we have audited
The consolidated financial statements of Li & Fung Limited (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) set out on pages 143 to 243, which comprise:

- the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2019;
- the consolidated profit and loss account for the year then ended;
- the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year then ended;
- the consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year then ended;
- the consolidated cash flow statement for the year then ended; and
- the notes to the consolidated financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting policies.

#### Our opinion
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2019, and of its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in compliance with the disclosure requirements of the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance.

### Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Hong Kong Standards on Auditing (“HKSAs”) issued by the HKICPA. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

### Independence
We are independent of the Group in accordance with the HKICPA’s Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (“the Code”), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code.

### Key Audit Matter
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Key audit matter identified in our audit is summarised as follows:

- Impairment assessment of intangible assets including goodwill

| Key Audit Matter | How our audit addressed the Key Audit Matter |
|:-----------------|:---------------------------------------------|
| **Impairment assessment of intangible assets including goodwill** | **We understood, evaluated and validated management’s key controls over the impairment assessment process.** |
| Refer to Notes 1.6, 2(A), 2(B) and 11 to the consolidated financial statements | We compared the methodology used (value-in-use calculations based on future discounted cash flows) by the Group to market practice. |
| Included on the consolidated balance sheet is an intangible assets balance of US$2,299 million as of 31 December 2019, which relates to goodwill of US$2,151 million, and system development, software, other license costs and other intangible assets of US$148 million which arose mainly from past acquisitions. | We obtained management’s future cash flow forecasts, tested the mathematical accuracy of the underlying value-in use calculations and agreed them to the approved one-year financial budget and future forecasts. We also compared historical actual results to those budgeted to assess the quality of management’s forecasts. |
| The Group is required to, at least annually, perform impairment assessments of goodwill and intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life. For intangible assets with useful lives, the Group is required to review them for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable, and at least annually, review whether there is any change in their expected useful lives. | We also assessed the reasonableness of key assumptions used in the calculations, comprising sales growth rates, gross profit margin, net profit margin and perpetual growth rate and discount rates. When assessing these key assumptions, we discussed them with management to understand and evaluate management’s basis for determining the assumptions, and compared them to external industry outlook reports and economic growth forecasts from a number of sources. |
| For the purpose of performing impairment assessments, all intangible assets including goodwill have been allocated to groups of cash generating units (“CGUs”). The recoverable amount of the underlying CGUs is supported by value-in use calculations which are based on future discounted cash flows. Management concluded that the intangible assets including goodwill were not impaired as of 31 December 2019. | We also engaged our valuation experts to assist us in assessing the reasonableness of the discount rates used by management by comparing the discount rates used to entities with similar risk profiles and market information. |
| We focused on this area as the assessments made by management involved significant estimates and judgments, including sales growth rates, gross profit margin, net profit margin and perpetual growth rates used to estimate future cash flows and discount rates applied to these forecasted future cash flows of the underlying CGUs. These estimates and judgments may be affected by unexpected changes in future market or economic conditions or discount rates applied. | We obtained and tested management’s sensitivity analysis around the key assumptions, to ascertain that selected adverse changes to key assumptions, both individually and in aggregate, would not cause the carrying amount of intangible assets including goodwill to exceed the recoverable amount. |
| | We evaluated management’s assessment on whether any events or change in circumstances indicate there may be a change in the expected useful lives of intangible assets. |
| | We found the Group’s estimates and judgments used in the impairment assessment and review of useful lives of intangible assets to be supported by the available evidence. |

### Other Information
The directors of the Company are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises all of the information included in the annual report other than the consolidated financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

### Responsibilities of Directors and the Audit Committee for the Consolidated Financial Statements
The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the disclosure requirements of the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

The Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.

### Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. We report our opinion solely to you, as a body, in accordance with Section 90 of the Companies Act 1981 of Bermuda and for no other purpose. We do not assume responsibility towards or accept liability to any other person for the contents of this report.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with HKSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with HKSAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the Audit Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide the Audit Committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the Audit Committee, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor’s report is **Cheng Woon Yin Michael**.

# Notes to the Financial Statements

## 1 Basis of Preparation and Principal Accounting Policies

The basis of preparation and principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.

### 1.1 Basis of Preparation

The consolidated financial statements of Li & Fung Limited have been prepared in accordance with all applicable Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”). They have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income and certain financial assets and financial liabilities (including derivative instruments, contingent consideration payable and written put option liabilities) at fair value through profit or loss or fair value at amortized cost.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with HKFRSs requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements, are disclosed in Note 2.

#### (A) NEW STANDARD, NEW INTERPRETATION AND AMENDMENTS TO EXISTING STANDARDS ADOPTED BY THE GROUP

The Group has applied the following new standard, new interpretation and amendments to existing standards for the first time for their annual reporting period commencing 1 January 2019:

- HKFRS 16: Leases
- HKFRS 9 Amendment: Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation
- HKAS 19 Amendment: Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement
- HKAS 28 Amendment: Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures
- HK(IFRIC) — Int 23: Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments
- Annual Improvement Project: Annual Improvements 2015–2017 Cycle

The application of the above new standard, new interpretation and amendments to existing standards effective in the current year has had no material effect on the Group’s reported financial performance and position for the current and prior years and/or disclosures set out in these consolidated financial statements, except for HKFRS 16 “Leases” which the Group had to change its accounting policies as set out in Note 1.22.

**HKFRS 16 Leases**

HKFRS 16 Leases addresses the classification, measurement and derecognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities related to leases which had previously been classified as “operating leases” under the principle of HKAS 17 Leases. These liabilities are measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using lessee’s incremental borrowing rate.

In accordance with the transition provisions in HKFRS 16, the new rule has been adopted retrospectively and comparative figures have been restated.

The impacts of the adoption of HKFRS 16 are as follows:

**Consolidated Profit and Loss Account**
**Year ended 31 December 2018**

| | As previously reported US$'000 | HKFRS16 US$'000 | Restated US$'000 |

#### (B) NEW STANDARD AND AMENDMENTS TO EXISTING STANDARDS THAT HAVE BEEN ISSUED BUT ARE NOT YET EFFECTIVE AND HAVE NOT BEEN EARLY ADOPTED BY THE GROUP

The following new standard and amendments to existing standards have been issued and are mandatory for the Group’s accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2020 or later periods, but the Group has not early adopted them:

| Standard/Amendment | Description |
|:---|:---|
| HKAS 1 and HKAS 8 Amendment | Definition of Material^1 |
| HKFRS 3 Amendment | Definition of Business^1 |
| HKFRS 10 and HKAS 28 Amendment | Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture^3 |
| HKFRS 17 | Insurance Contracts^2 |
| HKAS 39, HKFRS 7 and HKFRS 9 Amendment | Hedge accounting^1 |
| Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting 2018 | Revised Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting^1 |

**NOTES:**
> 1 Effective for financial periods beginning on or after 1 January 2020
> 2 Effective for financial periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021
> 3 Effective date to be determined

None of these is expected to have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.

### 1.2 Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and all its subsidiaries made up to 31 December 2019.

#### (A) SUBSIDIARIES

Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.

Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases.

The Group uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for business combinations. The consideration for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the aggregate of the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. On an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, the Group recognizes any non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s net assets.

Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the Group is recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration that is deemed to be an asset or liability is recognized in accordance with HKFRS 9 either in profit or loss or as a change to other comprehensive income. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured, and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.

The excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill (Note 1.6). If this is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference is recognized directly in the statement of comprehensive income.

Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealized gains on transactions between group companies are eliminated. Unrealized losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies and financial information of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost less impairment. Cost is adjusted to reflect changes in consideration arising from contingent consideration amendments. Cost also includes direct attributable costs of investment.

In the Company’s balance sheet the investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less provision for impairment losses (Note 1.7). The results of subsidiaries are accounted for by the Company on the basis of dividend received and receivable.

#### (B) TRANSACTIONS WITH NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS

The Group treats transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control as transactions with equity owners of the Group. For purchases from non-controlling interests, the difference between any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity.

#### (C) ASSOCIATED COMPANIES

Associated companies are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associated companies are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are initially recognized at cost, and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognize the investor’s share of the profit or loss of the investee after the date of acquisition. The Group’s investment in associated companies includes goodwill (net of any accumulated impairment loss) identified on acquisition (Note 1.6).

The Group’s share of its associated companies’ post-acquisition profits or losses is recognized in the consolidated profit and loss account, and its share of post-acquisition movements in other comprehensive income is recognized in other comprehensive income. The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment.

When the Group’s share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognize further losses, unless it has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.

The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in the associate is impaired. If this is the case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value and recognizes the amount adjacent to “share of net losses/profits of associated companies” in the consolidated profit and loss account.

Unrealized gains on transactions between the Group and its associated companies are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interests in the associated companies. Unrealized losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. The financial information of associated companies has been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

Dilution gains and losses in associates are recognized in the consolidated profit and loss account.

#### (D) JOINT VENTURE

Under the equity method of accounting, interests in joint venture are initially recognized at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognize the Group’s share of the post-acquisition profits or losses and movements in other comprehensive income. When the Group’s share of losses in joint venture equals or exceeds its interests in the joint venture (which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in the joint venture), the Group does not recognize further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture.

Unrealized gains on transactions between the Group and its joint venture are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the joint venture. Unrealized losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.

### 1.3 Segment Reporting

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker. The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified for making strategic decisions.

### 1.4 Foreign Currency Translation

#### (A) FUNCTIONAL AND PRESENTATION CURRENCY

Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (“the functional currency”). The consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollar, which is the Company’s functional and presentation currency.

#### (B) TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions or revaluation where items are remeasured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in the consolidated profit and loss account, except when deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges or qualifying net investment hedges.

Changes in the fair value of monetary securities denominated in foreign currency classified as financial assets at FVOCI are analyzed between translation differences resulting from changes in the amortized cost of the security and other changes in the carrying amount of the security. Translation differences related to changes in the amortized cost are recognized in profit or loss, and other changes in the carrying amount are recognized in other comprehensive income.

Translation differences on non-monetary financial assets and liabilities such as equities held at fair value through profit or loss are recognized in profit or loss as part of the fair value gain or loss. Translation differences on non-monetary financial assets such as equities classified as financial assets at FVOCI are included in the revaluation reserve in other comprehensive income.

#### (C) GROUP COMPANIES

The results and financial position of all the Group entities (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy) that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:

(i) assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet;
(ii) income and expenses for each profit and loss account are translated at average exchange rates (unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the transactions); and
(iii) all resulting exchange differences are recognized in other comprehensive income.

On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations, and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are taken to other comprehensive income.

On the disposal of a foreign operation (that is, a disposal of the group’s entire interest in a foreign operation, or a disposal involving loss of control over a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, a disposal involving loss of joint control over a joint venture that includes a foreign operation, or a disposal involving loss of significant influence over an associate that includes a foreign operation), all of the exchange differences accumulated in equity in respect of that operation attributable to the equity holders of the Company are reclassified to profit or loss.

In the case of a partial disposal that does not result in the Group losing control over a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, the proportionate share of accumulated exchange differences is re-attributed to non-controlling interests and is not recognized in profit or loss. For all other partial disposals (that is, reductions in the Group’s ownership interest in associates or joint ventures that do not result in the Group losing significant influence or joint control) the proportionate share of the accumulated exchange difference is reclassified to profit or loss.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. Exchange differences arising are recognized in equity.

### 1.5 Property, Plant and Equipment

#### (A) LAND AND BUILDINGS

Freehold land is stated at cost less impairment.

Buildings are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.

#### (B) OTHER PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

Other property, plant and equipment, comprising leasehold improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment, plant and machinery, motor vehicles and company boat, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.

#### (C) DEPRECIATION AND IMPAIRMENT

Freehold land is not depreciated. Other classes of property, plant and equipment are depreciated at rates sufficient to allocate their costs less accumulated impairment losses to their residual values over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis. The principal annual rates are as follows:

| Category | Principal annual rates |
|:---|:---|
| Leasehold land | shorter of lease term or useful life |
| Buildings and leasehold improvements | 2% – 20% |
| Furniture, fixtures and equipment and Plant and machinery | 6⅔% – 33⅓% |
| Motor vehicles and company boat | 15% – 20% |

The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period. An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount (Note 1.7). Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognized. All other repair and maintenance costs are expensed in the consolidated profit and loss account during the financial period in which they are incurred.

#### (D) GAIN OR LOSS ON DISPOSAL

The gain or loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment is the difference between the net sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the relevant item, and is recognized in the consolidated profit and loss account.

### 1.6 Intangible Assets

#### (A) GOODWILL

Goodwill represents the excess of the considerations transferred over the net fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets/liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired business/associated company/joint venture at the date of acquisition (Note 1.2). Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets. Goodwill on acquisitions of associated companies and joint venture is included in interests in associated companies and joint venture and is tested annually for impairment as part of the overall balance. Separately recognized goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.

Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made to those cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose identified according to operating segment. Each unit or groups of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purpose.

Goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment. The carrying value of goodwill is compared to the recoverable amount, which is the higher of value in use and the fair value less costs to sell. Any impairment is recognized immediately as an expense and is not subsequently reversed.

#### (B) SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT, SOFTWARE AND OTHER LICENSE COSTS

Acquired computer software licences are capitalized on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software. These costs are amortized over the estimated useful lives of 3 to 10 years.

Costs associated with developing or maintaining computer software programmes are recognized as an expense as incurred. Costs that are directly associated with the development of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group, and that will probably generate economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one year, are recognized as intangible assets. Costs include the employee costs incurred as a result of developing software and an appropriate portion of relevant overheads.

System development costs recognized as assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives of 3 to 10 years.

Brand licenses are license contracts entered into with the brandholders by the Group in the capacity as licensee. Brand licenses are capitalized based on the upfront costs incurred and the present value of guaranteed royalty payments to be made subsequent to the inception of the license contracts. Brand licenses are amortized based on expected usage from the date of first commercial usage over the remaining licence periods ranging from approximately 1 to 10 years.

#### (C) OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Intangible assets, other than goodwill, identified on business combinations are capitalized at their fair values. They represent mainly trademarks, buying agency agreements secured, and relationships with customers and licensors. Intangible assets arising from business combinations with definite useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis from the date of acquisition over their estimated useful lives ranging from 2 to 20 years.

### 1.7 Impairment of Investments In Subsidiaries, Associated Companies, Joint Venture and Non-Financial Assets

Assets that have an indefinite useful life, for example goodwill, are not subject to amortization and are tested annually for impairment. Assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units). Non-financial assets other than goodwill that suffer an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.

Impairment testing of the investments in subsidiaries, associated companies or joint venture is required upon receiving dividends from these investments if the dividend exceeds the total comprehensive income of the subsidiaries, associated companies or joint venture in the period the dividend is declared or if the carrying amount of the investment in the separate financial statements exceeds the carrying amount in the consolidated financial statements of the investee’s net assets including goodwill.

### 1.8 Financial Assets

#### (I) CLASSIFICATION

The Group classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories:

* those to be measured subsequently at fair value (either through other comprehensive income or through profit or loss); and
* those to be measured at amortized cost.

The classification depends on the business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows.

For assets measured at fair value, gains and losses will either be recorded in profit or loss or OCI. For investments in equity instruments that are not held for trading, this will depend on whether the Group has made an irrevocable election at the time of initial recognition to account for the equity investment at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI).

The Group reclassifies debt investments when and only when its business model for managing those assets changes.

#### (II) RECOGNITION AND DERECOGNITION

Regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognized on trade-date, the date on which the group commits to purchase or sell the asset. Financial assets are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or have been transferred and the group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.

#### (III) MEASUREMENT

At initial recognition, the group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL), transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at FVPL are expensed in profit or loss.

Financial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when determining whether their cash flows are solely payment of principal and interest.


**Debt instruments**

Subsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Group's business model for managing the asset and the cash flow characteristics of the asset. There are three measurement categories into which the group classifies its debt instruments:

* Amortized cost: Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost. Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is recognized directly in profit or loss together with foreign exchange gains and losses.
* FVOCI: Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial assets, where the assets' cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are measured at FVOCI. Movements in the carrying amount are taken through other comprehensive income, except for the recognition of impairment gains or losses, interest income and foreign exchange gains and losses which are recognized in profit or loss. When the financial asset is derecognized, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in other comprehensive income is reclassified from equity to profit or loss. Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method.
* FVPL: Assets that do not meet the criteria for amortized cost or FVOCI are measured at FVPL. A gain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at FVPL is recognized in profit or loss.

**Equity instruments**

The Group subsequently measures all equity investments at fair value. Where the Group's management has elected to present fair value gains and losses on equity investments in OCI, there is no subsequent reclassification of fair value gains and losses to profit or loss following the derecognition of the investment. Dividends from such investments continue to be recognized in profit or loss when the Group's right to receive payments is established.

Changes in the fair value of financial assets at FVPL are recognized in profit or loss.

#### (IV) IMPAIRMENT

The Group assesses on a forward looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its debt instruments carried at amortized cost and FVOCI. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk.

For trade receivables and other financial assets carried at amortized cost, the Group applies the simplified approach permitted by HKFRS 9, which requires lifetime expected losses to be recognized from initial recognition of the receivables. When determining the appropriate level of provision for impairment for individual trade categories, all relevant factors, generally for the Group or specifically for that financial asset category, will be considered. Indicators that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery include, amongst others, debtor insolvency proceedings, the failure of a debtor to make ongoing settlement with the Group, failure to make contractual payments for a period of greater than 365 days past due and failure to agree on a settlement plan. Further detail is set out in Note 38(b).

### 1.9 Inventories

Inventories comprise raw materials and finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost, calculated on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis, comprises purchase prices of inventories and direct costs (based on normal operating capacity). It excludes borrowing costs. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less applicable variable selling expenses.

### 1.10 Trade and Other Receivables

Trade and other receivables are recognized initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, less impairment. If collection of trade and other receivables is expected in one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer), they are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as non-current assets.

### 1.11 Share Capital

Ordinary shares are classified as equity.

Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.

### 1.12 Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and bank overdrafts.

### 1.13 Borrowings

Borrowings are recognized initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortized cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognized in the consolidated profit and loss account over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.

Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognized as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the draw-down occurs. To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee is capitalized as a prepayment for liquidity services and amortized over the period of the facility to which it relates.

Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.

### 1.14 Current and Deferred Tax

The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognized in the consolidated profit and loss account, except to the extent that it relates to items recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case the tax is also recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.

The current tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the Company's subsidiaries and associates operate and generate taxable income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.

Deferred tax is provided, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, the deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realized or the deferred tax liability is settled.

Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilized.

Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, associates, except for deferred tax liability where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred taxes assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.

### 1.15 Employee Benefits

#### (A) EMPLOYEE LEAVE ENTITLEMENTS

Employee entitlements to annual leave are recognized when they accrue to employees. A provision is made for the estimated liability for annual leave entitlements as a result of services rendered by employees up to the balance sheet date.

Employee entitlements to sick leave and maternity leave are not recognized until the time of leave.

#### (B) DISCRETIONARY BONUS

The expected costs of discretionary bonus payments are recognized as a liability when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of services rendered by employees and a reliable estimate of the obligation can be made.

Liabilities for discretionary bonus are expected to be settled within 12 months and are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when they are settled.

#### (C) POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS

The Group participates in a number of defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans throughout the world, the assets of which are generally held in separate trustee-administrated funds. The defined benefit pension plans are generally funded by payments from employees and by the relevant Group companies, taking into account of the recommendations of independent qualified actuaries.

The Group's contributions to the defined contribution plans are charged to the consolidated profit and loss account in the year to which the contributions relate.

For defined benefit plans, pension costs are assessed using the projected unit credit method. Under this method, the cost of providing pensions is charged to the consolidated profit and loss account so as to spread the regular cost over the service lives of employees in accordance with the advice of the actuaries who carry out a full valuation of the plans on an annual basis. The pension obligation is measured as the present value of the estimated future cash outflows, discounted by reference to market yields on high-quality corporate bonds which have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related liabilities. In countries where there is no deep market in such bonds, the market yields on government bonds are used. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. Past-service costs are recognized immediately in the consolidated profit and loss account.

The Group's net obligation in respect of long-service payments on cessation of employment in certain circumstances under the Hong Kong Employment Ordinance is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine the present value and reduced by entitlements accrued under the Group's retirement plans that are attributable to contributions made by the Group. The obligation is calculated using the projected unit credit method by a qualified actuary. The discount rate is determined by reference to market yields on high-quality corporate bonds which have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related liabilities. In countries where there is no deep market in such bonds, the market yields on government bonds are used.

#### (D) SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

The Group operates an equity-settled, share-based compensation plan. The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the Share Options/Award Shares is recognized as an expense. The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options/share awards granted:

* including any market performance conditions;
* excluding the impact of any service and non-market performance vesting conditions (for example, profitability, sale growth targets and remaining an employee of the entity over a specified time period); and
* including the impact of any non-vesting conditions (for example, the requirement for employees to save).

Non-market performance vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of Share Options/Award shares that are expected to vest. The total expense is recognized over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied. At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates on the number of Share Options/Award Shares that are expected to vest. It recognizes the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the consolidated profit and loss account, with a corresponding adjustment to employee share-based compensation reserve.

The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium when the options are exercised.

#### (E) SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS AMONG GROUP ENTITIES

The grant by the Company of Share Options/Award Shares over its equity instruments to the employees of subsidiary undertakings in the Group is treated as a capital contribution. The fair value of employee services received, measured by reference to the grant date fair value, is recognized over the vesting period as an increase to investment in subsidiary undertakings, with a corresponding credit to equity in the parent entity's financial statements.

### 1.16 Provisions

Provisions are recognized when: the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events; it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and the amount has been reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognized for future operating losses.

Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognized even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations may be small.

Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognized as interest expense.

### 1.17 Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets

A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events and whose existence will only be confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group. It can also be a present obligation arising from past events that is not recognized because it is not probable that outflow of economic resources will be required or the amount of obligation cannot be measured reliably.

A contingent liability is not recognized but is disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. When a change in the probability of an outflow occurs so that outflow is probable, it will then be recognized as a provision.

A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain events not wholly within the control of the Group.

Contingent assets are not recognized but are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements when an inflow of economic benefits is probable. When inflow is virtually certain, an asset is recognized.

### 1.18 Total Margin

Total margin includes gross profit and other recurring income relating to Services segment and Onshore Wholesale business of Product segment.

### 1.19 Core Operating Profit

Core operating profit is the profit before taxation generated from the Services segment and Onshore Wholesale business of Products segment excluding share of results of associated companies and joint venture, interest income, finance costs, taxation, material gains or losses which are of capital nature or non-operational related and acquisition related cost. This also excludes gain on remeasurement of contingent consideration payable and amortization of other intangible assets, which are non-cash items, and non-recurring reorganization costs and other non-core operating expenses which are non-operational items.

### 1.20 Revenue Recognition

#### (A) TURNOVER FROM SALES OF GOODS

Turnover from sales of goods are primarily generated by the Supply Chain Solutions of the Services segment and the Products segment. Supply Chain Solutions provides end-to-end sourcing solutions of goods through the global network to a diverse portfolio of global brands and retail customers, while Products segment focuses on Onshore Wholesale business.

Revenues are recognized when control of the goods has been transferred, being when the goods are delivered to the customers, the customers has full discretion over the channel and price to sell the goods, and there is no unfulfilled obligation that could affect the customers' acceptance of the goods. Delivery occurs when the goods have been shipped to the location specified by customer, the risks of obsolescence and loss have been transferred to the customers, and either the customer has accepted the goods in accordance with the sales contract, the acceptance provisions have lapsed, or the Group has objective evidence that all criteria for acceptance have been satisfied. Revenue is shown net of value-added tax, returns, claims and discounts and after eliminating sales within the Group.

The goods are often sold with volume rebate based on aggregate sales over a specific period. Revenue from these sales is recognized based on the price specified in the contract, net of the estimated volume rebate. Accumulated experience is used to estimate and provide for the discounts, using the expected value method, and revenue is only recognized to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur. A contract liability is recognized for expected volume rebate payable to customers in relation to sales made until the end of the reporting period.

A contract liability is also recognized when the customers pay deposits before the Group transfers control of the goods to the customers.

A receivable is recognized when the goods are delivered as this is the point in time that the consideration is unconditional because only the passage of time is required before the payment is due.

#### (B) SERVICES FEE FROM LOGISTICS BUSINESS

Logistics business of the Services segment includes in-country logistics and global freight management. In-country logistics business offers logistics services including distribution center management, order management and local transportation. Global freight management offers full services international freight solutions. Service income is recognized in the accounting period in which the provision of services occurs. Customers are invoiced upon the completion of services or on a regular basis.

Some contracts include multiple performance obligations and do not include any integration services. They are therefore accounted for as separate performance obligations. Revenue from each of the performance obligations is recognized at the stand-alone service price.

No element of financing is deemed present as the sales are made with a credit term up to 120 days, which is consistent with market practice.

### 1.21 Borrowing Costs

Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalized as part of the cost of that asset, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.

Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalization.

All other borrowing costs are charged to the consolidated profit and loss account in the year in which they are incurred.

### 1.22 Leases

As explained in Note 1.1(A) above, the Group has changed its accounting policy for leases where the Group is the lessee. The new policy is described below and the impact of the change in Note 1.1(A).

**Leased assets**

An arrangement, comprising a transaction or a series of transactions, is or contains a lease if the Group determines that the arrangement conveys a right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Such determination is made on an evaluation of the substance of the arrangement, regardless of whether the arrangements take the legal form of a lease.

*   **Assets leased to the Group**

    Leases are initially recognized as a right-of-use asset and corresponding liability at the date of which the leased asset is available for use by the Group. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to the consolidated profit and loss account over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. The right-of-use asset is amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term.

    Assets leased to the Group and the corresponding liabilities are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments:

    -   fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable; and
    -   payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group, as a lessee, exercising an option to terminate the lease.

    The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be determined, or the incremental borrowing rate of respective entities. Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following:

    -   the amount of the initial measurement of lease liabilities;
    -   any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, less any lease incentive received;
    -   any initial direct costs; and
    -   restoration costs.

    Payments associated with short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognized on a straight line basis as an expense in the consolidated profit and loss account. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets comprise equipment and small items of office furniture.

*   **Assets leased out by the Group**

    A lease is classified as a finance lease if it transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an underlying asset. A lease is classified as an operating lease if it does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an underlying asset.

    Where the Group leases out assets under operating leases, the assets are included in the consolidated balance sheet according to their nature and, where applicable, are amortized in accordance with the Group's amortization policies.


### 1.23 Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities

Derivatives are initially recognized at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value. The method of recognizing the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The Group designates certain derivatives as hedges of a particular risk associated with a recognized liability or a highly probable forecast transaction (cash flow hedge).

At the inception of the hedging, the Group documents the economic relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, including whether changes in the cash flows of the hedging instruments are expected to offset changes in the cash flows of hedges items. The Group documents its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking its hedge transactions.

The fair values of derivative financial instruments designated in hedge relationships are disclosed in Note 20. Movements in the hedging reserve in shareholders' equity are shown in Note 26. The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than 12 months; it is classified as a current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months. Trading derivatives are classified as a current asset or liability.

#### (A) CASH FLOW HEDGE

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recognized in hedge reserve. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognized immediately in the consolidated profit and loss account.

The Group generally designates only the change in fair value of the forward contract related to the spot component as the hedging instrument. Gains or losses relating to the effective portion of the change in the spot component of the forward contracts are recognized in the hedge reserve within equity. The change in the forward element of the contract that relates to the hedged item ('aligned forward element') is recognized within other comprehensive income in the costs of hedging reserve within equity. In some cases, the entity may designate the full change in fair value of the forward contract (including forward points) as the hedging instrument. In such cases, the gains or losses relating to the effective portion of the change in fair value of the entire forward contract are recognized in the hedge reserve within equity.

Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified in the periods when the hedged item subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial asset, both the deferred hedging gains and losses and the deferred time value of the option contracts or deferred forward points, if any, are included within the initial cost of the asset. The deferred amounts are ultimately recognized in profit or loss as the hedged item affects profit or loss (for example through cost of sales).

When a hedging instrument expires or is sold or terminated, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative deferred gain or loss and deferred costs of hedging in equity at that time remains in equity until the forecast transaction occurs, resulting in the recognition of a non-financial asset as inventory. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss and deferred costs of hedging that were reported in equity are immediately reclassified to the consolidated profit and loss account.

#### (B) DERIVATIVES AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS

Derivatives financial instruments recognized at fair value through profit or loss include certain derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting which is initially recognized at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value. Changes in the fair values of derivative financial instruments are recognized immediately in the consolidated profit and loss account.

### 1.24 Trade Payables

Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. Trade payables are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer). If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.

Trade payables are recognized initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.

### 1.25 Dividend Distribution

Dividend distribution to the Company's shareholders is recognized as a liability in the Group's and Company's financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Company's shareholders.

### 1.26 Treasury Shares

In relation to certain business combinations and Share Award Scheme, the Company may issue or purchase shares to escrow agents for the settlement of acquisition consideration payables and to the trustee of Share Award Scheme. The shares, valued at the agreed upon issue price or purchase price, including any directly attributable incremental costs, are presented as "treasury shares" and deducted from total equity. The number of shares held by escrow agent for settlement of acquisition consideration and by the trustee of Share Award Scheme would be eliminated against the corresponding amount of share capital issued in the calculation of the earnings per share for profit attributable to the shareholders of the Company.

### 1.27 Financial Guarantee Contract

Financial guarantee contracts are recognized as a financial liability at the time the guarantee is issued. The liability is initially measured at fair value and subsequently at the higher of

*   the amount determined in accordance with the expected credit loss model under HKFRS 9 Financial Instruments; and
*   the amount initially recognized less, where appropriate, the cumulative amount of income recognized in accordance with the principles of HKFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers.

The fair value of financial guarantees is determined based on the present value of the difference in cash flows between the contractual payments required under the debt instrument and the payments that would be required without the guarantee, or the estimated amount that would be payable to a third party for assuming the obligations.

Where guarantees in relation to loans or other payables of associates are provided for no compensation, the fair values are accounted for as contributions and recognized as part of the cost of the investment.

### 1.28 Non-current Assets Held-For-Sale and Discontinued Operations

Non-current assets (or disposal groups) are classified as held for sale when their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction and a sale is considered highly probable. The non-current assets (or disposal groups), except for certain assets as explained below, are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Deferred tax assets, assets arising from employee benefits, and financial assets (other than investments in subsidiaries and associates), which are classified as held for sale, would continue to be measured in accordance with the policies set out elsewhere in Note 1.

A discontinued operation is a component of the Group's business, the operations and cash flows of which can be clearly distinguished from the rest of the Group and which represents a separate major line of business or geographic area of operations, or is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.

When an operation is classified as discontinued, a single amount is presented in the profit and loss account, which comprises the post-tax profit or loss of the discontinued operation and the post-tax gain or loss recognized on the measurement to fair value less costs to sell, or on the disposal, of the assets (or disposal groups) constituting the discontinued operation.

### 1.29 Written Put Option Liabilities

The Discontinued Operations has granted a put option to a non-controlling interest shareholder of a subsidiary for the right to sell its full non-controlling interests to the Discontinued Operations. The Discontinued Operations recognizes the written put option liabilities initially at the present value of the redemption amount, which are determined in accordance with the terms under those relevant agreements and with reference to the estimated post-acquisition performance of the acquired business, and a corresponding debit in equity. The written put option liability is subsequently remeasured at fair value, with changes in measurement recognized in profit and loss.

## 2 Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments

Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.

### (A) Estimated Impairment of Intangible Assets Including Goodwill

The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment, in accordance with the accounting policy stated in Note 1.6. The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units have been determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations require the use of estimates (Note 11).

### (B) Useful Lives of Intangible Assets

The Group amortizes its intangible assets with finite useful lives on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives reflect the management's estimates of the periods that the Group intends to derive future economic benefits from the use of these intangible assets.

### (C) Income Taxes

The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. The Group recognizes liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.

## 3 Segment Information

The Company is domiciled in Bermuda. The Company is a limited liability company incorporated in Bermuda. The address of its registered office is Victoria Place, 5th Floor, 31 Victoria Street, Hamilton HM 10, Bermuda and its Hong Kong office is at 11/F, Li Fung Tower, 888 Cheung Sha Wan Road, Kowloon, Hong Kong.

The Group is principally engaged in managing the supply chain for retailers and brands worldwide with over 230 offices across key production markets globally. Turnover represents revenue generated from sales and services rendered at invoiced value to customers outside the Group less discounts and returns.

The Group divided the business into two segments: Services and Products. The Services segment consists of the Supply Chain Solutions and Logistics businesses. The Products segment consists of the Onshore Wholesale business and the three Product Verticals (furniture, beauty and sweaters) representing its principal-to-principal business.

In 2018, the Group divested the three Product Verticals to further simplify its business and facilitate sharper focus on the core sourcing business. The three Product Verticals are classified as Discontinued Operations and their net results for the year and the comparatives are excluded from the Products segment and presented separately as one-line item below net profit of the Continuing Operations. Further details of financial information of the Discontinued Operations are set out in Note 32 to the financial statements.

The Group’s management (Chief Operating Decision-Maker) considers the business of the Continuing Operations principally from the perspective of Services segment and the Products segment with the exclusion of the strategic divestment.

The Group’s management assesses the performance of the operating segments based on a measure of operating profit, referred to as core operating profit. This measurement basis includes profit of the operating segments before share of results of associated companies and joint venture, interest income, finance costs, taxation, material other gains or losses which are of capital nature, non-operational related or acquisition related. This also excludes any gain or loss on remeasurement of contingent consideration payable and amortization of other intangible assets which are non cash items, and non-recurring reorganization costs and other non-core operating expenses which are non-operational items. Other information provided to the Group’s management is measured in a manner consistent with that in these consolidated financial statements.

### 7 Earnings/(Losses) Per Share

The calculation of basic earnings/(losses) per share is based on the Group's profit attributable to Shareholders of US$16,748,000 (2018 (Restated): based on the Group's profit attributable to Shareholders arising from the Continuing Operations of US$122,836,000 and the Group's losses attributable to Shareholders arising from the Discontinued Operations of US$136,144,000) and on the weighted average number of 8,389,268,000 (2018: 8,369,665,000) shares in issue during the year.

The diluted earnings/(losses) per share was calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of 8,389,268,000 (2018: 8,369,665,000) ordinary shares in issue by 120,951,000 (2018: 113,438,000) to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares granted under the Company's Share Option and Share Award Scheme. For the determination of dilutive potential ordinary share granted under the Company, a calculation is done to determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value (determined as the average annual market share price of the Company's shares) based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to outstanding Share Options. The number of shares calculated as above is compared with the number of shares that would have been issued assuming the exercise of the Share Options and vesting of Award Shares.

#### Impairment Test for Goodwill

Goodwill is allocated to the Group’s cash-generating units (“CGUs”) identified according to operating segment.

A summary of goodwill by reporting segment is presented below.

| | 2019 | 2018 |
| :--- | ---: | ---: |
| | **US$'000** | US$'000 |
| **As at 31 December** | | |
| Services | 1,531,258 | 1,529,817 |
| Products | 619,600 | 616,108 |
| **Total** | **2,150,858** | **2,145,925** |


In accordance with HKAS 36 “Impairment of Assets” the Group completed its annual impairment test for goodwill allocated to the Group’s various CGUs by comparing their recoverable amounts to their carrying amounts as at the balance sheet date. Goodwill impairment reviews have been performed at the lowest level of CGU which generates cash flow independently. The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations use cash flow projections based on a one-year financial budget approved by management, extrapolated perpetually with an estimated general long-term continuous annual growth of not more than 5%. The discount rate used of approximately 11% is pre-tax and reflects specific risks related to the relevant segments. The budgeted gross margin and net profit margin are determined by management for each individual CGU based on past performance and its expectations for market development. Management believes that any reasonably foreseeable changes in any of the above key assumptions would not cause the carrying amount of goodwill to exceed the recoverable amount.

| | **US$'000** | US$'000 |
| Up to 90 days | 918,412 | 905,138 |
| 91 to 180 days | 77,014 | 97,862 |
| 181 to 360 days | 12,485 | 18,625 |

| **Total** | **1,017,189** | 1,040,236 |

There is no concentration of credit risk with respect to trade and bills receivable, as the Group has a large number of customers internationally dispersed.

The Group applies the HKFRS 9 simplified approach to measure expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade receivables. Lifetime expected losses are determined based on track records of settlements, taking into account payment arrangements, such as standby letters of credit, bank guarantees, credit insurance covered, back-to-back arrangement with suppliers.

As of 31 December 2019, trade receivables of US$991,834,000 (31 December 2018: US$1,003,693,000) that were not yet due or less than 90 days past due were not considered unrecoverable. Trade receivables of US$25,355,000 (31 December 2018: US$36,543,000) were past due over 90 days. These mainly relate to a number of independent customers for whom there is no recent history of default. Therefore, the lifetime expected losses ratios applied by the Group are considered an appropriate indication of the credit risks associated with trade receivables.

The ageing of these trade receivables is as follows:

| | 2019 | 2018 |
|:---|---:|---:|
| | **US$'000** | US$'000 |
| Not yet due to 90 days | 991,834 | 1,003,693 |
| 91 to 180 days | 5,351 | 10,474 |
| Over 180 days | 20,004 | 26,069 |
| **Total** | **1,017,189** | 1,040,236 |

Save as disclosed as above, the other classes within trade and other receivables do not contain impaired assets.

The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of each class of receivables mentioned above.

## 27 Perpetual Capital Securities

On 3 November 2016 and 8 November 2012, the Company issued perpetual subordinated capital securities (the “Perpetual Capital Securities”) with an aggregate principal amount of US$650 million and US$500 million respectively. The Perpetual Capital Securities do not have maturity date and the distribution payments can be deferred at the discretion of the Company. Therefore, the Perpetual Capital Securities were classified as equity instruments and recorded in equity in the consolidated balance sheet. The Company redeemed US$500 million Perpetual Capital Securities issued on 8 November 2012 in full on 25 May 2018. The amounts as at 31 December 2019 and 2018 included the accrued distribution payments.

Unsecured long-term notes issued to independent third parties in 2010 of US$374,361,000 will mature in 2020 and bear annual coupon of 5.25%. In 2019, the Group issued unsecured long-term notes of US$496,893,000 to independent third parties, which will mature in 2024 and bear annual coupon of 4.375%.

Non-current portion of purchase consideration payable for acquisitions is unsecured, interest-free and not repayable within twelve months. Balance of purchase consideration payable for acquisitions as at 31 December 2019 amounted to US$4,823,000 (2018: US$8,960,000), of which US$2,557,000 (2018: US$6,758,000) was primarily earn-out and US$2,266,000 (2018: US$2,202,000) was earn-up. Earn-out is a contingent consideration that will be realized if the acquired businesses achieve their respective base year profit target, calculated on certain predetermined basis, during the designated period of time. Earn-up is contingent consideration that will be realized if the acquired businesses achieve certain growth targets, calculated based on the base year profits, during the designated period of time. Details of earn-out and earn-up remeasurement are set out in Note 40.

| Long-service payment liabilities | 1,680 | 1,089 |
| | **9,633** | **11,592** |

> NOTE:
> The Group participates in a number of defined benefit plans in certain countries. Most of these pension plans are final salary defined benefit plans. The assets of the funded plans are held independently of the Group’s assets in separate trustee-administered funds. The Group’s defined benefit plans are valued by qualified actuaries annually using the projected unit credit method.

**(i) The amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheet is determined as follows:**

| | 2019 | 2018 |
|:---|---:|---:|

| Benefits paid | (3,736) | (6,888) |
| **At 31 December** | **33,213** | **34,336** |

**(v) The movements in net defined benefit liabilities recognized in the consolidated balance sheet are as follows:**

| | 2019 | 2018 |
|:---|---:|---:|
| | **US$'000** | US$'000 |
| **At 1 January** | **10,503** | **13,177** |

| **At 31 December** | **7,953** | **10,503** |

**(vi) The principal actuarial assumptions used for accounting purposes are:**

| | 2019 | 2018 |
|:---|:---:|:---:|
| | **%** | % |
| Discount rate | 0.6–7.7 | 0.9–8.1 |
| Salary growth rate | 2.3–9.0 | 2.4–8.0 |
| Pension growth rate | 3.3–5.0 | 2.4–6.0 |

---

### 29 Post-employment Benefit Obligations (continued)

**(vi) The principal actuarial assumptions used for accounting purposes are: (continued)**

The sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in the principal assumption is:

| | Impact on defined benefit obligation | | |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| | **Change in assumption** | **Increase in assumption** | **Decrease in assumption** |
| Discount rate | ±0.25% | -2.87% | +3.03% |

The above sensitivity analysis is based on a change in discount rate while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognized within the consolidated balance sheet.

The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared to the previous period.

**(vii) Plan assets comprised:**

| | 2019 | 2018 |
|:---|---:|---:|
| | **US$'000** | US$'000 |
| **Quoted assets** | | |
| Cash and cash equivalents | 9,083 | 9,549 |
| **Equity instruments** | | |
|   European | 2,316 | 2,330 |
|   American | 687 | 516 |
|   Asian | 716 | 909 |
|   Global | 172 | 44 |
| **Debt instruments** | | |

|   Mutual funds | – | 19 |
| **Others** | 105 | 154 |
| | **25,260** | **23,833** |

The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation ranges from 6.0 to 21.0 years.

### 29 Post-employment Benefit Obligations (continued)

**(viii) Expected maturity analysis of benefit payments:**

| | Within 10 years | Between 10-20 years | Beyond 20 years |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|
| **At 31 December 2019** | **US$'000** | **US$'000** | **US$'000** |
| Expected benefit payments | 18,187 | 20,923 | 55,159 |

The Group is exposed to a number of risks in relation to the defined benefit obligation, the most significant of which are detailed below:

| | |
|:---|:---|
| **Investment risk** | The defined benefit pension holds investments in asset classes, such as equities, which have volatile market values and while these assets are expected to provide real returns over the long term, the short term volatility can cause additional funding to be required if a deficit emerges. |
| **Interest rate risk** | The defined benefit pension’s liabilities are assessed using market yields on high quality corporate bonds to discount the liabilities. In countries where there is no deep market in such bonds, the market yields on government bonds are used. As the defined benefit pension holds assets such as equities, the value of the assets and liabilities may not move in the same way. |
| **Inflation risk** | A significant proportion of the benefits under the defined benefit pension are linked to inflation. Although the defined benefit pension’s assets are expected to provide a good hedge against inflation over the long term, movements over the short term could lead to deficits emerging. |
| **Mortality risk** | In the event that members live longer than assumed, a deficit will emerge in the defined benefit pension. |

In case of the funded plans, the Group ensures that the investment positions are managed within an asset-liability matching (ALM) framework that has been developed to achieve long-term investments that are in line with the obligations under the pension schemes. Within this framework, the Group’s ALM objective is to match assets to the pension obligations by investing in long-term fixed interest securities with maturities that match the benefit payments as they fall due and in the appropriate currency. The Group actively monitors how the duration and the expected yield of the investments are matching the expected cash outflows arising from the pension obligations. The Group has not changed the processes used to manage its risks from previous periods. The Group does not use derivatives to manage its risk. Investments are well diversified, such that the failure of any single investment would not have a material impact on the overall level of assets.

## 30 Deferred Taxation

Deferred taxation is calculated in full on temporary differences under the liability method using applicable taxation rates prevailing in the countries in which the Group operates.

The movements in the net deferred tax (assets)/liabilities are as follows:

| | 2019 | 2018 |
|:---|---:|---:|
| | **US$'000** | US$'000 |
| | | (Restated) |
| **At 1 January** | **(13,951)** | **(16,208)** |
| Charged to consolidated profit and loss account (Note 6) | (11,184) | (512) |
| Charged to other comprehensive income | 558 | 192 |
| (Credited)/charged to hedging reserve | (1,007) | 2,013 |
| Exchange differences | 631 | 564 |
| **At 31 December** | **(24,953)** | **(13,951)** |

Deferred tax assets are recognized for tax losses carried forward to the extent that realization of the related tax benefit through future taxable profits is probable. The Group has unrecognized tax losses of US$279,795,000 (2018: US$263,299,000) to carry forward against future taxable income, out of which US$1,483,000 will expire during 2020-2030. Deferred tax assets for these tax losses are not recognized as it is not probable that related tax assets will be utilized in the foreseeable future.

The movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities during the year, without taking into consideration the offsetting of balances within the same tax jurisdiction, are as follows:

| | Provisions | | Decelerated tax depreciation allowances | | Tax losses | | Others | | Total | |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| | 2019 | 2018 | 2019 | 2018 | 2019 | 2018 | 2019 | 2018 | 2019 | 2018 |

## 33 Transaction with Non-Controlling Interests

The Group treats transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control as transactions with equity owners of the Group. For purchases from non-controlling interests, the difference between any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the combined entity is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity.

On 8 August 2019, the Group completed a transaction with an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Temasek Holdings Private Limited ("Temasek"), pursuant to which Temasek acquired 21.7% interest of LF Logistics, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company before the transaction, through subscription of new shares issued by LF Logistics. The transaction does not result in loss of control by the Group in LF Logistics and therefore it has been accounted for as transactions with equity owners of the Group. The resulting gains on disposal to non-controlling interests has been recorded in equity.

## 38 Financial Risk Management

The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange risk, fair value interest rate risk, cash flow interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk, and liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimize potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.

### (a) Market Risk

#### (I) FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK

Most of the Group’s cash balances are in HK dollar and US dollar deposits with major global financial institutions, and most of the Group’s borrowings are denominated in US dollars.

The Group’s revenues and payments were transacted predominantly in US dollars. Therefore, it considers there is no significant risk exposure in relation to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. There are small portion of sales and purchases transacted in different currencies, for which the Group arranges hedging through foreign exchange forward contracts.

For transactions that are subject to foreign exchange risk, the Group hedges its foreign currency exposure once it receives confirmed orders or enter into customer transactions. To mitigate the impact from changes in foreign exchange rates, the Group regularly reviews the operations in these countries and makes necessary hedging arrangements in certain currencies against the US dollar.

However, the Group does not enter into foreign currency hedges with respect to the local financial results and long-term equity investments of its non-US dollar foreign operations for either the income statements or balance sheet reporting purposes. Since the Group’s functional currency is the US dollar, it is subject to exchange rate exposure from the translation of foreign operations’ local results to US dollars at the average rate for the period of group consolidation. The Group’s net equity investments in non-US dollar-denominated businesses are also subject to unrealized translation gain or loss on consolidation. Fluctuation of relevant currencies against the US dollar will result in unrealized gain or loss from time to time, which is reflected as movement in exchange reserve in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.

From a medium-to long-term perspective, the Group manages its operations in the most cost-effective way possible within the global network. The Group strictly prohibits any financial derivative arrangement merely for speculation.

At 31 December 2019, if the major foreign currencies, such as Euro and Pound Sterling, to which the Group had exposure had strengthened/weakened by 10% (2018: 10%) against US and HK dollar with all other variables held constant, profit for the year and equity would have been approximately 0.3% lower/higher (2018 (Restated): 0.2% lower/higher) and 2.4% higher/lower (2018 (Restated): 2.8% higher/lower), mainly as a result of foreign exchange gains/losses on translation of foreign currencies denominated trade receivables, borrowings and intangible assets.

#### (II) PRICE RISK

The Group is exposed to price risk because of investments held by the Group and classified on the consolidated balance sheet as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). The Group maintains these investments for long-term strategic purposes and the Group’s overall exposure to price risk is not significant.

At 31 December 2019 and up to the report date of the financial statements, the Group held no material derivative financial instruments except for certain foreign exchange forward contracts entered into for hedging of foreign exchange risk exposure on sales and purchases transacted in different currencies. At 31 December 2019, the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts entered into by the Group amounted to US$314,000 (2018: US$3,985,000 as derivative financial instruments (assets)), which has been reflected in full in the Group’s consolidated balance sheet as derivative financial instruments (liabilities).

#### (III) CASH FLOW AND FAIR VALUE INTEREST RATE RISK

As the Group has no significant interest-bearing assets, the Group’s income and operating cash flows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates.

The Group’s interest rate risk arises mainly from US dollar denominated bank borrowings and the US dollar denominated long-term notes issued. Bank borrowings at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. The Group’s policy is to maintain a diversified mix of variable and fixed rate borrowings based on prevailing market conditions.

At 31 December 2019, if the variable interest rates on the bank borrowings had been 0.1% higher/lower with all other variables held constant, profit for the year and equity would have been approximately US$869,000 (2018: US$634,000) lower/higher, mainly as a result of higher/lower interest expenses on floating rate borrowings.

### (b) Credit Risk

Credit risk mainly arises from trade and other receivables as well as cash and bank balances of the Group.

The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities. This arises primarily from its principal trading business, where the Group acts as a supplier, and working capital solutions, where it settles invoices earlier at a discount to certain suppliers via LF Credit. The Group therefore assumes direct counterparty risk for its customers in terms of these account receivables and inventory.

All new customers undergo a risk assessment process prior to trade terms being agreed in accordance with the Group’s global credit risk management framework. These assessments focus on the financial strength of individual customers as well as information specific to the customer and the economic environment in which each customer operates. To further reduce its exposure to credit risks, (a) the Group would require collateral (such as standby or commercial letters of credit, or bank guarantees) from customers if necessary, and (b) the Group has also taken out trade credit insurance to protect against losses arising from non-payment, and have entered into trade receivables factoring agreements with financial institutions on a non-recourse basis. Both receivable balances and inventory levels are reviewed regularly according to the Group’s credit policies and follow-up action is taken to recover overdue balances. Furthermore, the Group’s management reviews regularly the recoverable amount of its trade receivables to ensure that adequate impairment provision is made.

The Group applies the HKFRS 9 simplified approach to measure expected credit losses, which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade receivables.

For trade receivables not covered by customers’ standby letters of credit, bank guarantees, credit insurance or under a back-to-back payment arrangement with suppliers, the Group will apply impairment loss provisions, in whole or in part, when the Group has assessed the indicators whether the receivables are unrecoverable, has made all practical recovery efforts, and has concluded that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. Indicators that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery include, amongst others, debtor insolvency proceedings, the failure of a debtor to make ongoing settlement with the Group, a failure to make contractual payments on accounts receivable that are more than 365 days past due and a failure to agree on a settlement plan.

The provision for impairment is considered individually and collectively for different trade receivable categories. When determining the appropriate level of provision for impairment for individual trade receivable categories, the indicators outlined above will be considered both generally for the Group or specifically for that trade receivable category. As at 31 December 2019, based on these indicators, the composition and ageing of the trade receivables for which the Group has made provision for impairment as compared to gross trade receivables are as follows: for trade receivables not yet due to 90 days past due, 91 to 180 days past due and over 180 days past due is 0.2%, 15.8% and 28.5% respectively.

Impairment losses on trade receivables are presented as net impairment losses within core operating profit. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the same line item.

Receivables for which an impairment provision was recognized were written off against the provision when there was no expectation of recovering additional cash.

The provision for impairment for trade receivables during the year was set out in Note 21.

The impairment loss of other financial assets carried at amortized cost is measured based on the twelve months’ expected credit loss. As at 31 December 2019, trade receivables of US$11,317,000 (2018: US$49,040,000) and other receivables of US$533,000 (2018: US$2,240,000) have been provided for but none of the other financial assets including financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (Note 17) and due from related companies (Note 19) have been considered impaired as there is no recent history of default of the counterparties and ongoing payments are received. Impairment loss provisions will be considered if there are indicators that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery on these amounts, including if the counterparty fails to make contractual payments for a period of greater than 365 days past due.

The ageing of the trade amount due from other related companies based on due date is set out in Note 19.

Global Brands Group is a related party of the Group. As at 31 December 2019, the total accounts receivable from Global Brands Group amounted to US$533,766,000. Following the divestment of its US wholesale business in October 2018, Global Brands Group underwent major restructuring efforts to turn around its business. Whilst Global Brands Group’s financial condition has improved as a result of these restructuring efforts, Global Brands Group’s cash flow, which was partly impacted by one-time restructuring charges, was not yet sufficient to settle all shipments of goods on time in 2019.

Due to the slowdown in the settlement of accounts receivable, the ageing profile of accounts receivable from Global Brands Group deteriorated in 2019 with US$147,909,000 overdue 91 to 180 days and US$141,363,000 overdue 181 to 365 days (compared to US$77,017,000 overdue 91 to 180 days and US$15,147,000 overdue 181 to 365 days as at the end of 2018). Global Brands Group continues to pay and settle its outstanding receivables on a monthly basis. There are no accounts receivable being overdue more than 365 days. Accordingly and in compliance with its accounting policies, the Company has concluded that no accounts receivable provisions are required as at 31 December 2019.

The maximum exposure of these other financial assets to credit risk at the reporting date is their carrying amounts.

### (c) Liquidity Risk

Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash on hand and the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities from the Group’s bankers.

Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity reserves (comprises undrawn borrowing facilities and cash and cash equivalents (Note 22)) on the basis of expected cash flow.

The table below analyzes the liquidity impact of the Group’s non-derivative financial liabilities (including annual coupons payable for the long-term notes) into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period from the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date. The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows and these amounts will not reconcile to the amounts disclosed on the consolidated balance sheet and in Note 28 for long-term liabilities.

| Lease liabilities | 141,444 | 87,767 | 148,797 | 82,121 |

All of the Group’s gross settled derivative financial instruments are in hedge relationships and are due to settle within 12 months of the balance sheet date. These contracts require undiscounted contractual cash inflows of US$166,062,000 (31 December 2018: US$166,295,000) and undiscounted contractual cash outflows of US$166,186,000 (31 December 2018: US$159,933,000).

## 39 Capital Risk Management

The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.

In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.

Consistent with others in the industry, the Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital. Net debt is calculated as total borrowings (including short-term bank loans (Note 24), long-term bank loan (Note 24) and long-term notes (Note 28)) less cash and cash equivalents (Note 22). Total capital is calculated as total equity, as shown in the consolidated balance sheet, plus net debt.

The Group’s strategy is to maintain a gearing ratio not exceeding 35%. The gearing ratios at 31 December 2019 and 2018 were as follows:

| | 2019 | 2018 |
|:---|---:|---:|
| | **US$'000** | US$'000 |
| | | (Restated) |
| Long-term bank loan (Note 24) | 300,000 | 1,034 |
| Short-term bank loans (Note 24) | 4,906 | 272,951 |
| Long-term notes (Note 28) | 871,254 | 751,405 |
| | **1,176,160** | **1,025,390** |
| Less: Cash and cash equivalents (Note 22) | (932,167) | (612,391) |
| **Net debt** | **243,993** | **412,999** |
| Total equity | 2,112,786 | 1,854,832 |
| **Total capital** | **2,356,779** | **2,267,831** |
| **Gearing ratio** | **10%** | **18%** |

## 40 Fair Value Estimation

The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different levels have been defined as follows:

*   Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1).
*   Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices) (level 2).
*   Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) (level 3).

The following table presents the Group's assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value at 31 December 2019.

| | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 | Total |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |

## 40 Fair Value Estimation (continued)

The fair values of financial instruments traded in active markets are based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date. A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service, or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm’s length basis. The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price. These instruments are included in level 1.

The fair values of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) are determined by using valuation techniques. These valuation techniques maximize the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.

If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3.

Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments include:

*   Quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments.
*   The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts is determined using forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date, with the resulting value discounted back to present value.
*   Other techniques, such as discounted cash flow analysis, are used to determine fair value for the remaining financial instruments.

There was no significant transfer of assets between level 1, level 2 and level 3 fair value hierarchy classifications during the year.

The following summarizes the major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of the significant assets and liabilities classified as level 2 or 3 and the valuation process for assets and liabilities classified as level 3:

### Derivative Financial Instruments Used for Hedging

The Group relies on bank valuations to determine the fair value of financial assets/liabilities which in turn are determined using discounted cash flow analysis. These valuations maximize the use of observable market data. Foreign currency exchange prices are the key observable inputs in the valuation.

## 40 Fair Value Estimation (continued)

### Purchase Consideration Payable for Acquisitions

The Group recognizes the fair value of those purchase considerations for acquisitions, as of their respective acquisition dates as part of the consideration transferred in exchange for the acquired businesses. These fair value measurements require, among other things, significant estimation of post-acquisition performance of the acquired businesses and significant judgment on time value of money. These calculations use cash flow projections for post-acquisition performance. The discount rate used is based on the then prevailing incremental cost of borrowings of the Group at time of acquisitions, which approximated 2.5%.

The following table presents the changes in level 3 instruments for the year ended 31 December 2019 and 2018.

| | 2019 | | 2018 | |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |

No significant transactions, arrangements and contracts in relation to the Group’s business to which the Company was a party and in which a director of the Company had a material interest, whether directly or indirectly, subsisted at the end of the year or at any time during the year.

## 43 Subsequent Event

Following the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus in early 2020, precautionary and control measures including quarantine, travel restrictions and temporary production halts have been and continue to be implemented across China and around the world in many other countries which are relevant to the Group’s business and operations.

The further spread and continuation of the COVID-19 virus is expected to affect consumer sentiment and the overall retail environment, which the Group believes could last throughout the year. Given the COVID-19 virus impact is creating more volatility and uncertainty in the global economy, the Group’s customers will likely be negatively impacted. However, the spread and impact of the COVID-19 virus is still developing and its impact on the global economy and the likely impact on the Group’s business and operations is extremely difficult to assess.

The Group has taken relevant actions to minimize the impact of the COVID-19 virus to its operations and will continue to pay close attention to developments and evaluate their impact on the financial position and operating results of the Group.

In preparing the financial statements, the impact of the COVID-19 virus has not been considered because it is a post balance sheet non-adjusting event and the financial impact, including the assessment of risk associated with the Group’s operations, the adequacy of provision for impairment of receivables and the present value of estimated future cash flow of the CGUs in the goodwill impairment test, has yet to be ascertained but will be reflected in future financial statements when the actual impact is known.

## 44 Approval of Financial Statements

The financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on 20 March 2020.
