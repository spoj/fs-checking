# Notes to the Financial Statements

## 1 Basis of Preparation and Principal Accounting Policies
The basis of preparation and principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.

### 1.1 Basis of Preparation
The consolidated financial statements of Li & Fung Limited have been prepared in accordance with all applicable Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards ("HKFRSs"). They have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income and certain financial assets and financial liabilities (including derivative instruments, contingent consideration payable and written put option liabilities) at fair value through profit or loss or fair value at amortized cost.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with HKFRSs requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements, are disclosed in Note 2.

#### (A) NEW STANDARD, NEW INTERPRETATION AND AMENDMENTS TO EXISTING STANDARDS ADOPTED BY THE GROUP
The Group has applied the following new standard, new interpretation and amendments to existing standards for the first time for their annual reporting period commencing 1 January 2019:

- **HKFRS 16** Leases
- **HKFRS 9 Amendment** Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation
- **HKAS 19 Amendment** Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement
- **HKAS 28 Amendment** Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures
- **HK(IFRIC) — Int 23** Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments
- **Annual Improvement Project** Annual Improvements 2015–2017 Cycle

The application of the above new standard, new interpretation and amendments to existing standards effective in the current year has had no material effect on the Group's reported financial performance and position for the current and prior years and/or disclosures set out in these consolidated financial statements, except for HKFRS 16 "Leases" which the Group had to change its accounting policies as set out in Note 1.22.

**HKFRS 16 Leases**
HKFRS 16 Leases addresses the classification, measurement and derecognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities related to leases which had previously been classified as "operating leases" under the principle of HKAS 17 Leases. These liabilities are measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using lessee's incremental borrowing rate.

In accordance with the transition provisions in HKFRS 16, the new rule has been adopted retrospectively and comparative figures have been restated.
